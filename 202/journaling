#010000

Journalling doesn't appear to be working on an ext3 file-system. When booting, the following line appears:
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.

What could be causing the problem?
1. An old version of e2fsprogs is installed.
2. The kernel does not contain ext3 support.
3. The file-system is specified as ext2 in/etc/fstab.
4. The system was not shut down cleanly.
